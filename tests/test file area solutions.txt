Test STL file is a triangulation of shapes that added together have different projected 
view areas for each X, Y, and Z., with an analytically exact solution per below.

The X and Y directions are exact values due to their triangular nature. 
For the Z value, there are circles involved, and the tessellation of the 
file is fine enough that the area should be measured to nearly exactly this value. 

in X direction: 2.000000 m^2
in y direction: 6.000000 m^2
in Z direction: 5.570796 m^2

These values can test the program for correct scaling and rendering.

If the fit and resolution is set correctly there should be less than 0.001m^2 error
between program output and these values.
